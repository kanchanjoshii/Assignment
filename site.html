		<h1> SITE REPORT </h1>
		<p>The module in which I was enrolled at NAMI college to pursue my bachelor's degree is quite fascinating. The teachers who are instructing me are very familiar and professional. My college's learning environment is both healthy and competitive. To complete this assignment, we were taught HTML and CSS. To make this webpage responsive and interesting, I used various tags such as hover and media query. I also used javascript to make the webpage more responsive with a hamburger menu. I attempted to use javascript in a minimalistic manner in order to express my knowledge of HTML and CSS.s
