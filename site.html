		<h1> SITE REPORT </h1><br><br>
		<p>The module in which I was enrolled at NAMI college to pursue my bachelor's degree is quite fascinating. The teachers who are instructing me are very familiar and professional. My college's learning environment is both healthy and competitive. To complete this assignment, we were taught HTML and CSS.I knew the fundamentals of HTML but had no experience with CSS. To make this webpage responsive and interesting, I used various tags such as hover and media query. I also used javascript to make the webpage more responsive with a hamburger menu. I attempted to use javascript in a minimalistic manner in order to express my knowledge of HTML and CSS. I choosed extremely simple way to design my webpage. The illustration depicts Hamburger as described in the assignment brief. When the assignment first began, I was frustrated and demotivated, but as things progressed, I discovered that I enjoy coding. For me, the changes I observed while coding were quite interesting and satisfying. Several codes caused me problems during this process. I had issues such as codes not being executed and confusion about codes and their usage. There were a few issues with debugging and validation as well. Overcoming various challenges and working on it provided me with a wealth of knowledge and enjoyment. My teacher's advice has been invaluable. He is the one who truly inspired me to continue working on the assignment. His advice provided me with a wealth of module knowledge.I am grateful to my module teacher for his efforts in advancing my knowledge to a new level.
